# Breakout Game in Python

This is a simple version of the Breakout game made as a tribute to the original Atari game.

:heavy_check_mark: It uses the **turtle** and **tkinter** modules for graphic interface

:heavy_check_mark: To make it a bit different from the original version the blocks are of random lengths and colors, and also have random gaps between them.
